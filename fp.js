// Make the underlying type "undoable".
//
// Factor out history management from business logic.
//
// I've never had a calculator with an "undo" feature before.  I've
// implemented "undo/redo" before, in different ways. This
// implementation is by far the simplest, and most robust I've yet
// managed, though it works by keeping complete copies of previous
// states. Some sort of caching machinery would be involved if your
// state type is large.
//
// Essentially, an RPN calculator is such a trivial state machine
// compared to the raw power of even a smart phone, that we can afford
// to keep a log of every action and prior state for a given session.
//
// This might prove problematic with persistent storage, and some care
// should be put in to the UX around saving / loading / expiring
// history. There's a convenience factor for having the histiory be
// persistent, but that has to be balanced against privacy and storage
// concerns
//
// What is lacking here is a coherent strategy for handling errors.
//  - only catch "UserError" or some given error subclass from here.
//  - set error field on resulting state
//  - should not prevent further input
//  - if last operation was UserError error, should not mutate undo or redo stack.
//  - subsequent valid operation should clear error field.
//  - other unhandled exceptions propagate up the stack.
